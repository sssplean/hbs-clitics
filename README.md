# HBS Enclitics

This repository contains a small interactive page for practicing the placement of
Serboâ€‘Croatian enclitics. The exercise logic and example sentences are entirely
client side, so you only need to open `index.html` in a modern browser.

## Prerequisites

The project does not depend on any build tools or frameworks. A recent web
browser is sufficient.

If you prefer to run the page from a local web server instead of opening the
file directly, Node.js can be used with a simple static server, for example:

```bash
npx http-server
```

After starting the server, navigate to the printed URL and open `index.html`.

## Development and Contribution

Contributions are welcome via pull requests. There are no automated tests or
Node scripts at the moment, so changes can be tested by simply reloading the
page in the browser.
